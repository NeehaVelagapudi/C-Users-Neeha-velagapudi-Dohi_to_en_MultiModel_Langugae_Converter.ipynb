# 📝 Multimodal Language Converter (Hindi to English)

This notebook demonstrates a **Multimodal Language Converter** that translates **Hindi to English**, using both **text and speech inputs**. It integrates:

- Text-based translation  
- Speech-to-text conversion  
- Language translation (Hindi → English)  
- Output via both **text and synthesized speech**

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multimodal Input**  
  Accepts either:
  - Text input (Hindi)
  - Audio input (speech) which is converted to Hindi text

- **Language Translation**  
  Translates Hindi to English using a pre-trained Transformer model (`Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-hi-en`)

- **Text Summarization (Optional)**  
  Summarizes the translated English text using models from Hugging Face or the `sumy` library

- **Text-to-Speech Output**  
  Converts the translated or summarized English text into speech using `gTTS` or `pyttsx3`
